# Vercel Landing Page Clone (HTML + CSS)

This project is a clean and responsive clone of the Vercel landing page built using only HTML and CSS.  
It focuses on layout structure, spacing, typography, and a professional dark theme UI without using the colorful gradient from the original Vercel design.

The project is intended for learning, practice, and portfolio demonstration purposes.
